## Abstract
  This paper analyzes the deaths of shelter residents in Toronto from 2007 to 2023. Using data provided by the city, we explore patterns in the number of deaths over time, identifying possible trends and factors contributing to these outcomes. The analysis reveals a concerning rise in deaths in recent years, highlighting the need for further investigation into the underlying causes. This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing conversation about homelessness and public health in Toronto.

## Introduction
  Homelessness is a pressing issue in many major cities, and Toronto is no exception. The deaths of shelter residents reflect broader societal challenges related to housing, mental health, substance abuse, and public health. This paper examines data on the deaths of shelter residents in Toronto between 2007 and 2023, using this information to identify trends and patterns that could inform policy and public health interventions.

  The analysis focuses on the number of deaths over time, considering potential factors such as weather, public health crises, and changes in shelter capacity. By examining these trends, we aim to provide a clearer picture of the risks faced by individuals living in shelters and how these risks may have evolved in recent years.

  The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset and the methods used to analyze it. Section 3 presents the findings from our analysis, and Section 4 discusses the implications of these findings for public policy and future research.

## Data
  The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Open Data Toronto, titled "Deaths of Shelter Residents". This dataset includes records of deaths that occurred among residents of Toronto shelters from 2007 to 2023. The dataset contains variables such as the year of death, the cause of death, and demographic information (where available). The data were last updated in 2023 and are publicly available here.

  Data Summary:
  Time Period: 2007-2023
  Key Variables: Year of death, age of deceased, cause of death
  Number of Records: Over 1,000 deaths recorded

  This dataset provides a valuable resource for understanding the mortality rate among shelter residents and identifying potential factors that could be addressed to reduce these numbers. Ethical considerations in using this data include sensitivity to the dignity and respect of individuals represented in the dataset, and ensuring that findings are used to advocate for positive social change rather than perpetuating stigma.

## Analysis
  Trends in Deaths Over Time: Using ggplot2, a line graph will illustrate the number of deaths each year from 2007 to 2023. A noticeable increase in deaths in recent years suggests that conditions within shelters or broader social factors are worsening.

  Age Distribution of Deaths: A histogram will visualize the ages of deceased shelter residents. This can highlight whether certain age groups are more vulnerable, which may suggest targeted interventions.

  Cause of Death: Using a bar chart, the causes of death can be categorized, with attention to the increase in deaths from overdoses or other public health issues.
